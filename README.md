# Time-Conversion
This program converts Date and time by pulling the system time on the machine and outputs it to a local time format. It also gives the Julian day and year along with the time. The date that the time starts and dates back to in the SSE Format box is Jan 1, 1970 when the first computer came online at the NRO. The Epoch day format adds 11 days to the Julian Day format depending on what calendar is used around the world. The user can also input a specified date and time into the box and it will convert to the parameters set forth by the program. This code is unable to be ran on GitHub because it would be running in a headless environment and it is not a headless program.
